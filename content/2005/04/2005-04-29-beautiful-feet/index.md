\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Ok, so I've been priviledged to be playin Indoor Soccer with some guys and girls from Church at Castle Hill on Friday nights, and I'm having a blast doing it. Nothing like a little exercise to get the adrenalin up and the blood pumping. I've played a total of 3 games and out of those I've scored once.

Anyhoo, tonight we played a team calling themselves 'Bits & Pieces'. The game was pretty exciting and we ended up winning 2-1. I didn't score any goals, but I did setup both of them. **Shaun** and **Sue** were our goal-scorers for the week.

Next week we have a bye, which is unfortunate, but as it turns out, extremely convenient since I have to help setup for a wedding which I am doing sound for.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
