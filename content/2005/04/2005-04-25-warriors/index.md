So today I went out to St Ives Village Green to break with **El Shaddai Crew** at Ignite the Flame Festival. It was a really good day, we hung out, talked to kids, did some breakin and this and that all to the glory of God. It's really refreshing to see guys that live for Christ and are infiltrated fully by him. I met some of the girls from **Breakthru' Artz** as well which was nice.
