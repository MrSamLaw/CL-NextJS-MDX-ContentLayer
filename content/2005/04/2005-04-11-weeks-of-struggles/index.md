\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Man it's been ages and ages since I've updated this thing!!! So what's been happening??! Not a whole heap in the grand scheme of things actually.

Over Easter I went to Katoomba Easter Convention ([www.kcc.org.au](http://www.kcc.org.au)) with my family, and learnt plenty about The Holy Spirit. There were quite alot of people from church there, so I got to hangout with them somewhat.

Apart from that things have been fairly average in terms of events and all, going along to Bible Study, doing Munchkins with the preschool aged kids.

I did have some family troubles with them blaming me for the internet not working, but we sorted that out one night with a big talk. Turns out they had some troubles with me being unemployed cause of all the strain on them as well.

If anyone can offer job tips, or help me out with acquiring a job then get in touch, it'd be mucho appreciated.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
