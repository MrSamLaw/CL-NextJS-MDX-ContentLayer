\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Happy New Year!!! It's the year of the Rooster and with it comes a few traditions. We're supposed to clean up things before the new year and in days of old my parents used to get new clothes and new shoes etc etc. Dad always talks about how he only ever got new shoes at the new year and this only happened a couple of times... if that... (poor chap).

So I've cleaned my room up (somewhat), but there still some more to go...Â ![](images/tidyDesk.jpg)

Another (good) tradition is lucky money in the form of red envelopes. I'm not sure on the whole deal, but married relatives give them out and they generally contain money.

Monday is my 25th birthday, and as things roll about with New Year and my 25 years of existance on this planet, I'm trying to make a few changes in my life in terms of habits and thought patterns.

It's kinda funny, when I was studying my brain activity seemed to have an active lifestyle, but since I've been unemployed, my brain power is limiting itself and this is something that needs to be rectified.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
