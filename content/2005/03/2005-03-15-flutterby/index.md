\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Things have been pretty stagnant, slow and slack over the last two days. Yesterday was almost a complete write off with pretty much procrastination and time wastage the whole day long. This morning was much the same, but I consciously decided to get up and out of the house for the afternoon and go and do some work where the self-distractions are less.

Armed with about 7 reference resumes/CVs, an email from **Mike Barry** of \[Redacted\], my latest sketchbook, several pens and a pacer, I headed off to Macquarie Centre to sink my teeth/hands into some design related work, both for getting me a job and improving my skills. Odd place I know, especially when Multimedia usually consists of computerised stuff, but I actually managed to get a fair whack of work done.

I proceeded to '_The Loft Cafe_' and 2 Lattes' later I'd gone through the CVs and found some good language to use and several pointers for structure and style, as well as planning some CHONGLAND extensions and refurbishments, including **Jacques De** and **Lambs2Slaughter** 'mini-sites'.

Big bonus was some of the company that happened to be at the cafe, let's just say that she is real pretty and has a great smile. Luckily I got to have a short chat and that was expanded on/developed later on.

The bad thing is that I'm struggling to get to sleep now, not sure if it's the 2 Lattes' or if it's the great feeling that comes about when you talk to a nice person, but if this keeps up I might need some sleeping pills or something. All in all a good day that seems to be shaping up a great week to come. Props to all involved\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
