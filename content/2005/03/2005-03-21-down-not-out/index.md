\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Howdy peoples, Havin some real troubles in the emotions department at the moment, not too happy.

Guessin that unemployment has a pretty big part to do with it.

As a human being we're relational beings and I guess that means that we tend to crave contact, interaction and approval from other humans, and I guess from animals as well.

This is something that I'm kind of lacking, or not appreciating those which I have. It's complicated and I'm pretty sure that yall don't wanna hear about it, so I'll leave it, but know that it's a big problem and if I somehow vanish or disappear then this is most probably the reason why.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
