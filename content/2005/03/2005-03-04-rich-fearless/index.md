\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]I just saw '_The Aviator_' with **James**, **Shaun**, **Rod**, **Amy** and **Big Pauly**.

It was an interesting film with many ups and downs. I find it amazing the calibre of mind that rich people have, when I say rich, I mean rich business people generally. They seem to be able to come up with these large scale ideas that are pretty risky, yet they have almost no qualms about it (well, nothing visible).

I don't believe I'll be a rich businessman anytime soon, cause I have trouble deciding what to buy at the grocery store, and fearless?? well, I'm even afraid to talk to certain girls... Nuff Said!!!\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
