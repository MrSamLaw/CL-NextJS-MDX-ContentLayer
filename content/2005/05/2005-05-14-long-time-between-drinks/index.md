\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Howdy ladies and gentleman, well things are moving along quite well, I've found a job of some sorts.

I am working in the Library at Macquarie University as a book sorter/shelver. It's an interesting job, get to use a good mix of my brain and my body, plus the environment is relaxing.

Apart from work, I've been hangin out with people from church, and playin some indoor soccer. Last night we won 6-3. I didn't score any goals, but got a few assists and a bucketload of free kicks forfeited by a few angry players.

Let it be known that Little Sam doesn't like to stand down to the rough and tough. I do however have a saw jaw from a nasty arm that connected without punishment, but we take what we get yeah??\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
