\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Well tonight I did my exam for my PTC (Preliminary Theological Certificate) course: Intro to the Bible.

The course has been going well, despite my lack of study, I've been able to grasp a good overview of the bible, especially coming to understand that it reveals Gods plan to restore a right relationship with fallen man to bring man into his rest and share in his blessings.

If people get the chance to do any PTC courses, I highly recommend Intro to the Bible!!!\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
