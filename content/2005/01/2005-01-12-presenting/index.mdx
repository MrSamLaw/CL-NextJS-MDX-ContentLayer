\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]First entry in what I hope to be a long running and not too long winded blog. I've actually had this thing since April 2004 and haven't touched it. But with the new year and all, I've decided that it's time to let people know about me and what I'm doing, hence Blogness.

Some people know, some people don't, some people think they know but have no idea!! So let me set the record straight. My name is Samuel Law, but people call me Sam, Jacques De, CHONG, that guy in white that dances real good. First and foremost I am a faithful child of God, although at times it doesn't seem that way. I am on the path to becoming a designer, after completing a Diploma and Certificate IV in Multimedia in 2003, but that doesn't seem to be working out for me at this present time, although I'm confident that God will lead me to a place where I am happy, productive and challenging myself and other people. But that's enough about me for now, I don't generally like to blow my own horn. If you stick with this blog for long enough you'll get to know me and my nature, and hopefully discover different facets of my varying personality in all it's glory.

On to what I actually wanted to talk about today... [CHONGLAND](http://www.chongland.com/) is going v2.0. It's been a long time coming, but I've finally got enough effort and stayability to go ahead and revamp the site. Within the month the rebuild should be complete, but for the moment it will be blog and forums on CHONGLAND whilst I'm jetsetting across Asia and such. ETA on something will be in a couple of days. So check CHONGLAND then and sign up for forums and get interacting with me, or check CHONGLAND now and see what I've done in the past.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
